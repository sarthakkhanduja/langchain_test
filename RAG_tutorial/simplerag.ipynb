To test the solutions, the ﬁrst step is\\nto use a vehicular trafﬁc simulator with an appropriate scenario\\nin order to reproduce realistic mobility patterns. Many mobility\\nsimulators are available, and the choice is usually done based on\\nthe size and type of simulation required, but a common problem\\nis to ﬁnd a realistic trafﬁc scenario. In order to evaluate and\\ncompare new communication protocols for vehicular networks,\\nit is necessary to use a wireless network simulator in combination\\nwith a vehicular trafﬁc simulator. This additional step introduces\\nfurther requirements for the scenario. The aim of this work is to\\nprovide a scenario able to meet all the common requirements\\nin terms of size, realism and duration, in order to have a\\ncommon basis for the evaluations. In the interest of building\\na realistic scenario, we decided to start from a real city with a\\nstandard topology common in mid-size European cities, and real\\ninformation concerning trafﬁc demands and mobility patterns.\\nIn this paper we show the process used to build the Luxembourg\\nSUMO Trafﬁc (LuST) Scenario, and present a summary of its\\ncharacteristics together with an overview of its possible use cases.\\nIndex Terms —Vehicle-to-X Simulation, Infrastructure-to-X\\nSimulation, Scenario Generation\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nFor years, transportation engineers have studied the trafﬁc\\nand mobility patterns in cities. With the ever growing urban\\ntelecommunication networks, the amount of trafﬁc information\\nthat can be collected, aggregated and redistributed is increas-\\ning. This facilitates the research on transportation systems and\\nmobility patterns, but also introduces new problems related\\nto the communication required among all the interconnected\\ndevices used to gather trafﬁc data. Many researchers are\\nworking in a variety of areas that range from crowd-sourcing\\nof information to safety applications. They are also making\\nstructural studies concerning infrastructure communications,\\ntrafﬁc light systems, and more generally Intelligent Transporta-\\ntion Systems (ITS). In spite of the fact that both transportation\\nengineers and the vehicular networking community are work-\\ning on similar problems, the requirements and the scale of the\\ntools that are used is different. The transportation community\\nis mainly focused on trafﬁc optimization and urban planning\\nand is rarely interested in the behaviour of the single vehicle.On the other hand, the networking community is concerned\\nabout the position and behaviour of the single vehicle and\\nhow this impacts on the communications and the related\\napplications.\\nIn order to study mobility patterns, trafﬁc congestion or new\\ncommunication protocols, we need a vehicular trafﬁc simulator\\nand an appropriate scenario to evaluate new proposals in\\na realistic environment. There are different kinds of trafﬁc\\nsimulators that differ in the typology of the simulation that\\ncan be run (e.g. macro-, meso- and microscopic simulators).\\nMacroscopic trafﬁc simulators focus on the trafﬁc ﬂows, but\\ndo not take into consideration the single vehicle in the ﬂow.\\nFor the vehicular networking community, the behaviour of a\\nsingle vehicle is usually of interest and needs to be modelled\\ncarefully, thus microscopic simulators are generally preferred.\\nOnce the simulator is chosen, the common problem is that\\nthere are no properly-working and freely-available scenarios\\nfor the community.\\nDue to the lack of usable scenarios, the usual approach\\nis to build a simple scenario that fulﬁlls the purpose of the\\napplication. This approach results in several problems that are\\nwell known to the community, the most prominent being the\\nlack of repeatable experiments allowing the comparison of\\ndifferent solutions or approaches that solve the same problem.\\nAnother problem that may be encountered is the speciﬁcity\\nof the scenario and the consequent lack of generalization or\\nrealism.\\nIn order to focus on Vehicle-to-X problems and solutions,\\nthe community needs a scenario that fulﬁlls the following\\nrequirements: (1) It has to be able to support different kinds\\nof trafﬁc demand such as congested or free-ﬂow patterns. (2)\\nIt should support different scenario dimensions. (3) It has to\\ninclude different road categories (e.g. residential, arterial and\\nhighway). (4) It should allow multi-modal trafﬁc evaluations\\n(e.g. vehicles, public transport and pedestrian). (5) It should\\ndescribe a realistic trafﬁc scenario (i.e. avoid gridlocks and\\nunrealistic mobility patterns) over one day in order to include\\nthe trafﬁc mobility during rush hour (high density), during\\nthe day (moderate density) and during the night (low density).\\nOur goal is to create a mobility scenario able to meet all the\\nabove mentioned requirements, and to make it freely available\\nto the community in order to have a common reference for the', metadata={'source': 'example_research_paper.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='different experiments.\\nWe decided to use the road network of a real city as basis\\nfor our scenario in order to reproduce real trafﬁc demand and\\nmobility patterns. We chose the City of Luxembourg because\\nits topology is comparable to that of many of European cities\\nand because of available trafﬁc statistics, which can be used\\nto calibrate the trafﬁc demand. Another advantage is that its\\nsize is reasonable in terms of complexity for a microscopic\\nsimulator.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\\nreviews the different trafﬁc scenarios available to the vehicular\\nnetworking community and explains their limitations. Section\\nIII explains in details how the LuST Scenario has been built\\ncovering aspects such as the road topology, the population and\\nthe trafﬁc demand, and the different kind of vehicles involved.\\nSection IV presents an overview of the possible use cases\\nfor the scenario. The paper concludes in Section V with a\\nsummary of the beneﬁts and capabilities of the LusT Scenario\\nand the future work.\\nII. R ELATED WORK\\nOver the last few years, a great amount of work has been\\ndone by the vehicular networking community. New trafﬁc and\\nnetwork simulation tools have been presented, and the problem\\nof developing a reliable and usable mobility scenario has been\\nencountered multiple times.\\nAmong the vehicular trafﬁc simulators we can ﬁnd propri-\\netary tools such as Visum [1] and VisSim [2], which are mainly\\nused to study trafﬁc ﬂow optimizations and trafﬁc demands.\\nMulti-agent trafﬁc simulators such as MATSim [3], are able to\\nsimulate the single vehicles, but they are more focused on the\\nrouting choices of the agents compared to the physics behind\\nthe behaviour of the vehicles. Another vehicular simulator\\nis SUMO (Simulator of Urban MObility) [4], a microscopic\\ntrafﬁc simulator that supports on-line interaction and close\\nloop feedback through the TraCI [5] interface. It is able to\\nsimulate multi-modal trafﬁc, trafﬁc lights, inductive loops and\\nother detectors.\\nConcerning the different scenarios available to the vehicular\\nnetworking community, SUMO provides the TAPASCologne\\n[6] scenario package, which includes road networks imported\\nfrom OpenStreetMap (OSM) [7] and the trafﬁc demand for the\\nperiod between 6:00 and 8:00 in the morning. Unfortunately\\nthis scenario is difﬁcult to use and requires additional work\\nto improve the network quality, and to verify how routes are\\nmapped onto both the network and the trafﬁc demand.\\nIn 2014, during the SUMO User Conference, a realistic\\ntrafﬁc scenario from the city of Bologna [8] was released to the\\ncommunity. The scenario, built in the iTETRIS [9] framework,\\ngives a very good starting point for the community, but it\\npresents some limitations. The trafﬁc demand is only deﬁned\\nover one hour, and the size of the scenario, which is relatively\\nsmall, provides only one neighbourhood, lacking in generality.\\nAnother possibility is the Sioux Falls test scenario [10].\\nThis is a small scale, multi-modal test-bed with realistic trafﬁc\\ndemand, integrates all the major features of MATSim such aspoints of interest, secondary location choice, and a population\\nwith heterogeneous socio-demographic parameters. In this\\ncase the scenario covers only the main streets. In addition,\\nMATSim would not be easy to couple with a wireless networks\\nsimulator. The simulator implements a close loop feedback\\nin order to optimize the mobility, but it does not provide an\\nexternal interface to interact with it.\\nIn 2015, ITS Austria West [11] presented a real life trafﬁc\\nmonitoring system that uses a mesoscopic version of SUMO\\n(this version of the simulator is not freely available). This\\nproject monitors a road network with 248,749 nodes and\\n323,282 road segments with a total length of 27,437 km.\\nThey have ﬁve different trafﬁc information sources providing\\nﬂoating car data and a trafﬁc demand model for the simulation\\nof 1.2 million routes and 1.6 million vehicles.\\nThe ITS Austria West scenario is a very good example of\\nthe effort required to build and maintain a trafﬁc scenario.\\nThere exist many other scenarios that are well designed, but\\nthese are not freely available to the community as they often\\nrely on proprietary information.\\nWith LuST Scenario we wanted to build a tool for the\\nscientiﬁc community. In order to do so, we used only freely\\nand publicly available datasets and software.\\nIII. L UST S CENARIO\\nTopology\\nIn order to create a realistic scenario we decided to start\\nfrom a real mid-sized European city. The topology of many\\nEuropean cities consists of a central downtown area, sur-\\nrounded by all its different neighbourhoods, which are linked\\nby arterial roads [12]. Another important characteristic is the\\npresence of a highway on the outskirts that surrounds the city.\\nThe size of the metropolitan area is another very important\\nproperty: the scenario must be big enough to show the standard\\ncongestion patterns visible in modern cities, but it must be\\nadequately small to permit simulations in a reasonable amount\\nof time. The City of Luxembourg meets those requirements.\\nAfter choosing the city, we used OpenStreetMap (OSM)\\nto extract its road topology. An OSM ﬁle contains all the\\nnecessary information about the environment and its accuracy\\nhas been detailed in [13]. We used JOSM [7] to extract and\\nmanually select and change points of interest and road seg-\\nments. In this phase we retrieved information about roads (of\\nany kind), trafﬁc lights, locations and names of bus stops; we\\nalso saved additional information about schools (i.e. location\\nand kind) to be used in the activity generation process, and\\nthe geometry of the buildings in order to create the polygons\\nrequired for the obstacles, important component for wireless\\nnetworks simulations.\\nMobility simulator\\nThe choice of the mobility simulator depends on the kind\\nof studies that have to be done. In case of vehicular communi-\\ncations studies [14], the vehicular mobility has to be coupled\\nwith a network simulator, therefore a micromobilty simulator\\nsuch as SUMO is appropriate for our needs.', metadata={'source': 'example_research_paper.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Fig. 1. LuST Scenario Topology.\\nAs the aim of this scenario is to have a working SUMO\\nsimulation, all the intersections were checked manually for\\ncorrectness. Using an iterative process with JOSM, netconvert\\n[15] and SUMO, we ensure that no intersection represented\\nan unrealistic bottleneck for the trafﬁc ﬂows. This iterative\\nprocess was necessary in order to construct a road network\\nwith the proper intersection geometry and segment shape\\nrequired by SUMO. These changes resulted in some minor\\ndifferences in the topology (i.e. the angle between two streets\\nmay be different and that would slightly change the shape\\nof the roads) that had to be taken into consideration while\\ngenerating bus stops, bus routes and the polygons for the\\nbuildings.\\nTo provide more ﬂexibility, we decided not to impose any\\nvehicle restrictions on any edge or lane (i.e. we removed the\\nlanes reserved for speciﬁc type vehicles). In order to maintain\\nthe trafﬁc patterns close to reality, we modiﬁed the number of\\nlanes in some segments of the roads. We tried to standardise\\nthe roads in order to obtain a scenario that could easily be\\nmodiﬁed or extended.\\nFigure 1 shows the topology of the LuST Scenario, with\\nstreets coloured by type. The highway is depicted in blue, the\\nmain arterial roads in red and the residential roads in black.\\nThe static information contained in the roads network topology\\nﬁle is summarised in Tables I and II.

In the SUMO network ﬁle, an edge is deﬁned\\nas a segment between two nodes, it may have a shape, and it\\nis divided in one or more lanes.\\nDemographics\\nIn order to achieve realistic trafﬁc patterns we used the\\ndata published by the government, which is available on the\\nInternet site of the Luxembourg National Institute of Statistics\\nand Economic studies (STATEC) [16] (e.g. population, ageTABLE I\\nTOPOLOGY INFORMATION .\\nArea 155.95 km2\\nTotal nodes 2,372\\nTotal edges 5,969\\nTotal length edges 931.12 km\\nTotal length lanes 1,571.4 km\\nEdges with 1 lane 3,944\\nEdges with 2 lanes 1,188\\nEdges with 3 lanes 764\\nEdges with 4 lanes 78\\nTABLE II\\nINTERSECTIONS INFORMATION .\\nRoundabouts 39\\nTotal junctions 4,341\\nTrafﬁc lights 203\\nUnregulated 16\\nPriority 1,914\\nInternal 1,969\\nDead end 239\\ndistribution) to generate the activity demand for the ACTIV-\\nITYGEN [17] tool. The conﬁguration ﬁles required by the\\ntool must contain information concerning the topology of the\\ncity, demographic information about the population, schools,\\nworkplaces and residential areas. All of these are retrieved\\nfrom OSM and STATEC.\\nMobility\\nThe trafﬁc model is based on a mobility study that describes\\ntrafﬁc characteristics over recent years [18]. We decided to\\ntune the trafﬁc demand between 200,000 and 300,000 vehicles\\nper day, depending on which trafﬁc demand we want to\\nsimulate (details are in Section Trafﬁc Demand ). The public\\ntransport database was used to retrieve the information about\\nbus routes [19]. A total of 563 bus stops were added to the\\nscenario. As shown in Table III, we added 38 bus routes inside\\nthe city for a total of 2,336 buses over the 24 hours period. The\\nlocation of the bus stops in the LuST Scenario is not the same\\nas the one in the OSM ﬁle (as mentioned earlier), however we\\ntried to keep them as close as possible. For this reason, we had\\nto rebuild the bus routes to match the new bus stop locations.\\nFigure 2, depicts the recomputed bus routes (in red). Figure\\n3 shows an intersection located in the city centre; the yellow\\nsquares are the inductive loops positioned 5m [20] from the\\nintersection and the green boxes annotated with an H are the\\nbus stops. With an additional conﬁguration ﬁle it is possible\\nto deﬁne location and sampling behaviour of the inductive\\nloops. We positioned them at every intersection with a trafﬁc\\nlight, on the highway, and on the on and off ramps (see Table\\nIV). We ﬁxed the location of each inductive loop close to the\\nintersection to allow dynamic adjustments of the trafﬁc light\\nsystem using the information provided by the detectors as a\\nfeasible extension of the simulation. In case of the inductive\\nloops situated on the highway, one of the possible usage is the\\nmonitoring of trafﬁc ﬂows on the peripheral roads.', metadata={'source': 'example_research_paper.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Depending\\non the purpose of the simulation, it is possible to leave out\\nthe transit trafﬁc demand, keeping a realistic mobility for the\\nurban area and improving the simulation speed.\\nThe short report provided by SUMO at the end of the\\nsimulation for both the complete mobility and the local plus\\nbuses one is shown in Table V. In the percentage column we\\nsee that all the issues (e.g. teleports and emergency stops)\\nthat may be experienced by a vehicle during the simulation\\nare lower than 0.2%, indicating that the scenario is running\\nsmoothly without bottlenecks and gridlocks.

The two\\nbells represent the urban trafﬁc in the city and the extra-urban\\none on the highway. In order to provide a smooth mobility\\nscenario, we use the dynamic routing mechanism provided\\nby SUMO.

U SECASES\\nThe LuST Scenario is a framework that provides realistic\\nmobility patterns for a mid-size city. The mobility traces\\nprovided can be used as an input for other types of simulators\\nsuch as NS3 or OMNet++ in order to evaluate network\\nprotocols. We will now show how the LuST scenario can\\nbe used in association with Veins [24] to obtain a closed-\\nloop feedback between SUMO and OMNet++. Using LuST\\nin combination with those tools allows the study of both,\\nthe performance of Vehicular-to-X protocols and the related\\napplications. Further, the scenario allows to evaluate different\\nmulti-modal strategies (e.g. for commuters). Using Veins, it\\nis possible to conﬁne the computation of the connectivity\\nnetwork to a restricted area, enabling the simulation of a\\nsmaller trafﬁc scenario that only uses a subset of the available\\nroad network, allowing testing of protocols and applications\\non different scales without changing the mobility patterns.\\nIn our urban area there are 203 intersections managed by\\na trafﬁc light system. These intersections can be used to\\ntest different optimisation strategies (e.g. green waves) or\\nemergency protocols to allow ﬁreﬁghters, ambulances or the\\npolice to be prioritised.\\nIn the next paragraph we explore in more detail two possible\\nuse cases of the LuST Scenario. In the ﬁrst, we vary the\\npercentage of vehicles allowed to change their route in case\\nof congestion, and in the second we use Veins and OMNet++\\nto compute the average number of ﬁrst-hop neighbours that\\nconnected vehicles encounter in a smaller area of the city.\\nRouting\\nFor the default scenario, 70% of the vehicles are equipped\\nwith a routing device, allowing to change route if a congestion\\nis encountered. We motivate this parameter by the fact that\\nmost of the local commuters are familiar with the road network\\nand know at least one alternative path. Further, more and more\\ncars are equipped with real time navigation services allowing\\na better usage of the available road capacity.\\nFig. 8. Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function of the number of route\\nchanges in the different scenarios.\\nIn SUMO, each vehicle can be equipped with different\\nkinds of devices in order to interact with their environment.\\nUsing the on-board routing system, it is possible to change the\\npercentage of cars that react to their surroundings, obtaining\\nscenarios with different levels of congestion to test different\\nrouting strategies. We decided to vary the percentage of\\nvehicles equipped with the routing device from 50% to 90%\\nand evaluate the impact on the number of route changes\\nfor each vehicle and the impact on the experienced waiting\\ntime. Figure 8 present the Empirical Cumulative Distribution\\nFunction (ECDF) for the number of route changes in the\\nexperiments, we see that lowering the percentage of vehicles\\nthat are allowed to react to trafﬁc congestion increases the\\nnumber of route changes for the ones that are equipped with\\na routing system. Nevertheless, even with only 50% of the\\nvehicles equipped with the routing device, 95% of the vehicles\\nin the simulation change their route less than 4 times.\\nThe waiting time experienced by the vehicles is another\\ninteresting aspect impacted by the percentage of vehicles\\nequipped with a routing system. The waiting time is deﬁned\\nas the number of seconds in which the vehicle speed is\\nlower than 0.1 m/s during the simulation. Given its deﬁnition,\\nthe waiting time is a fair measurement of trafﬁc congestion.\\nFigure 9 present its ECDF. Here the difference between the\\nexperiments is more visible. In case of 50% of vehicles\\nequipped with the device, we see that more than 15% of the\\nvehicle spend more than 30 minutes blocked in trafﬁc, which,\\nfor this scenario, represents 45.000 vehicles. In case of 70%\\nof vehicles equipped with the device (default value) only 2%\\nor 3% of the vehicles will experience a waiting time longer\\nthan 30 minutes.\\nIt is important to consider that the shape of the trafﬁc\\ndemand will change by varying the percentage of rerouted\\nvehicles.

A more detailed study\\nconcerning the impact of this kind of behaviour can be found\\nin [26].\\nClustering\\nWith this use case we show how to reduce the size of\\nthe experiment to a smaller area and use a wireless network\\nsimulator in order to have an estimation of the number of\\nvehicles (cluster) encountered during a trip.TABLE VIII\\nSTATISTICS OF THE BUSINESS DISTRICT SCENARIO .\\nMedian Mean St. Deviation\\nTrip length [m] 1,226.94 1,517.49 1,287.68\\nSpeed [m/s] 13.03 13.84 5.27\\nWith Buildings\\nVeh. enc per sec 6.59 8.09 6.38\\nWithout Buildings\\nVeh. enc per sec 14.62 16.18 9.52\\nWe used OMNet++ with Veins to simulate a IEEE 802.11p\\n[27] on-board unit that broadcast beacons every second to\\ncompute the number of vehicles in range.

The resizing of the simulation scenario\\nto this area can be done both in SUMO and in OMNet++.\\nReshaping the scenario in SUMO will imply a change in the\\nmobility pattern given that all the vehicles with an origin out-\\nside the area will not be simulated.

In the TAPAS\\nCologne paper [6] the authors provided an extensive evaluation\\nof the clustering of the vehicles for their scenario compared\\nto two mobility traces for the cities of Turin and Zurich.\\nWe were not able to obtain the latter so we rely on the\\nﬁndings referenced in the TAPAS Cologne paper. The aim\\nis to prove that the scenario is realistic and that this metric\\nis crucial in order to have reliable result in case of the\\nevaluation of a network protocol. Their argument is about the\\nfact that in the other mobility traces, given the higher degree of\\nconnected nodes, the network would result more stable, mining\\nthe reliability of the results obtained for the evaluation of a\\nnetwork protocol, and the same architecture with the other\\ntraces could lead to over-optimistic results. We completely\\nagree with this conjecture, and we would like to add that the\\npresence of the building in the LuST Scenario brings a higher\\nlevel of realism as the signal propagation is considered. In\\norder to be comparable with the TAPAS Cologne scenario,\\ngiven that the presence of buildings is never mentioned, we\\nrun the same experiment with and without polygons for the\\nchannel simulation. As expected, in case of simulation without\\nbuildings, the average size of the clusters is larger compared\\nto the one with the polygons (from approximatively 16 to\\napproximatively 8 nodes), and this has an impact on the\\nreliability of the evaluation [28].', metadata={'source': 'example_research_paper.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

The Luxem-\\nbourg SUMO Trafﬁc (LuST) Scenario meets all the common\\nrequirements needed for a common basis for the evaluation\\nof network protocols and related applications. To build this\\nscenario we started from a real mid-size city, with a typical\\nEuropean road topology and mobility patterns. The LuST\\nscenario covers an area of 156 km2and 932 km of roads. There\\nare 38 different bus routes with 563 bus stops. All intersec-\\ntions with trafﬁc lights and all highway ramps are equipped\\nwith inductive loops. We generate the trafﬁc demand using\\nreal information provided by various data sources. We have\\ndiscussed several use cases for the LuST Scenario. Among\\nthem are the evaluation and testing of network protocols, and\\napplications for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).\\nAs new features are provided by the SUMO simulator, the\\nscenario can be enriched with other transportation modes (e.g.\\npedestrian, bicycle). At the moment the trafﬁc light system\\nuses a static scheduler; among the additional functionality\\nwe want to provide, is a dynamic version of the trafﬁc light\\nsystem.\\nThe preliminary version of the LuST Scenario has been\\npresented at the SUMO User Conference 2015. Since then,\\nthe trafﬁc demand and the polygons have been improved.\\nThe scenario is freely available under the MIT license\\nto the whole community and it is hosted on GitHub\\n(https://github.com/lcodeca/LuSTScenario).\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis AFR project with the project number 5761149 is\\nfunded by the Fond Nationale de la Recherche (FNR), Lux-\\nembourg.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] “Visum ofﬁcial Internet site.” http://vision-trafﬁc.ptvgroup.com/en-\\nuk/products/ptv-visum/, August 2015.\\n[2] M.

This additional step introduces\\nfurther requirements for the scenario. The aim of this work is to\\nprovide a scenario able to meet all the common requirements\\nin terms of size, realism and duration, in order to have a\\ncommon basis for the evaluations. In the interest of building\\na realistic scenario, we decided to start from a real city with a\\nstandard topology common in mid-size European cities, and real\\ninformation concerning trafﬁc demands and mobility patterns.\\nIn this paper we show the process used to build the Luxembourg\\nSUMO Trafﬁc (LuST) Scenario, and present a summary of its\\ncharacteristics together with an overview of its possible use cases.\\nIndex Terms —Vehicle-to-X Simulation, Infrastructure-to-X\\nSimulation, Scenario Generation\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nFor years, transportation engineers have studied the trafﬁc\\nand mobility patterns in cities. With the ever growing urban\\ntelecommunication networks, the amount of trafﬁc information\\nthat can be collected, aggregated and redistributed is increas-\\ning. This facilitates the research on transportation systems and\\nmobility patterns, but also introduces new problems related\\nto the communication required among all the interconnected\\ndevices used to gather trafﬁc data. Many researchers are\\nworking in a variety of areas that range from crowd-sourcing\\nof information to safety applications. They are also making\\nstructural studies concerning infrastructure communications,\\ntrafﬁc light systems, and more generally Intelligent Transporta-\\ntion Systems (ITS). In spite of the fact that both transportation\\nengineers and the vehicular networking community are work-\\ning on similar problems, the requirements and the scale of the\\ntools that are used is different. The transportation community\\nis mainly focused on trafﬁc optimization and urban planning\\nand is rarely interested in the behaviour of the single vehicle.On the other hand, the networking community is concerned\\nabout the position and behaviour of the single vehicle and\\nhow this impacts on the communications and the related\\napplications.\\nIn order to study mobility patterns, trafﬁc congestion or new\\ncommunication protocols, we need a vehicular trafﬁc simulator\\nand an appropriate scenario to evaluate new proposals in\\na realistic environment. There are different kinds of trafﬁc\\nsimulators that differ in the typology of the simulation that\\ncan be run (e.g. macro-, meso- and microscopic simulators).\\nMacroscopic trafﬁc simulators focus on the trafﬁc ﬂows, but\\ndo not take into consideration the single vehicle in the ﬂow.\\nFor the vehicular networking community, the behaviour of a\\nsingle vehicle is usually of interest and needs to be modelled\\ncarefully, thus microscopic simulators are generally preferred.\\nOnce the simulator is chosen, the common problem is that\\nthere are no properly-working and freely-available scenarios\\nfor the community.\\nDue to the lack of usable scenarios, the usual approach\\nis to build a simple scenario that fulﬁlls the purpose of the\\napplication. This approach results in several problems that are\\nwell known to the community, the most prominent being the\\nlack of repeatable experiments allowing the comparison of\\ndifferent solutions or approaches that solve the same problem.\\nAnother problem that may be encountered is the speciﬁcity\\nof the scenario and the consequent lack of generalization or\\nrealism.\\nIn order to focus on Vehicle-to-X problems and solutions,\\nthe community needs a scenario that fulﬁlls the following\\nrequirements: (1) It has to be able to support different kinds\\nof trafﬁc demand such as congested or free-ﬂow patterns.

We chose the City of Luxembourg because\\nits topology is comparable to that of many of European cities\\nand because of available trafﬁc statistics, which can be used\\nto calibrate the trafﬁc demand. Another advantage is that its\\nsize is reasonable in terms of complexity for a microscopic\\nsimulator.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\\nreviews the different trafﬁc scenarios available to the vehicular\\nnetworking community and explains their limitations.

The paper concludes in Section V with a\\nsummary of the beneﬁts and capabilities of the LusT Scenario\\nand the future work.\\nII. R ELATED WORK\\nOver the last few years, a great amount of work has been\\ndone by the vehicular networking community. New trafﬁc and\\nnetwork simulation tools have been presented, and the problem\\nof developing a reliable and usable mobility scenario has been\\nencountered multiple times.\\nAmong the vehicular trafﬁc simulators we can ﬁnd propri-\\netary tools such as Visum [1] and VisSim [2], which are mainly\\nused to study trafﬁc ﬂow optimizations and trafﬁc demands.\\nMulti-agent trafﬁc simulators such as MATSim [3], are able to\\nsimulate the single vehicles, but they are more focused on the\\nrouting choices of the agents compared to the physics behind\\nthe behaviour of the vehicles. Another vehicular simulator\\nis SUMO (Simulator of Urban MObility) [4], a microscopic\\ntrafﬁc simulator that supports on-line interaction and close\\nloop feedback through the TraCI [5] interface. It is able to\\nsimulate multi-modal trafﬁc, trafﬁc lights, inductive loops and\\nother detectors.\\nConcerning the different scenarios available to the vehicular\\nnetworking community, SUMO provides the TAPASCologne\\n[6] scenario package, which includes road networks imported\\nfrom OpenStreetMap (OSM) [7] and the trafﬁc demand for the\\nperiod between 6:00 and 8:00 in the morning. Unfortunately\\nthis scenario is difﬁcult to use and requires additional work\\nto improve the network quality, and to verify how routes are\\nmapped onto both the network and the trafﬁc demand.\\nIn 2014, during the SUMO User Conference, a realistic\\ntrafﬁc scenario from the city of Bologna [8] was released to the\\ncommunity. The scenario, built in the iTETRIS [9] framework,\\ngives a very good starting point for the community, but it\\npresents some limitations. The trafﬁc demand is only deﬁned\\nover one hour, and the size of the scenario, which is relatively\\nsmall, provides only one neighbourhood, lacking in generality.\\nAnother possibility is the Sioux Falls test scenario [10].\\nThis is a small scale, multi-modal test-bed with realistic trafﬁc\\ndemand, integrates all the major features of MATSim such aspoints of interest, secondary location choice, and a population\\nwith heterogeneous socio-demographic parameters. In this\\ncase the scenario covers only the main streets. In addition,\\nMATSim would not be easy to couple with a wireless networks\\nsimulator. The simulator implements a close loop feedback\\nin order to optimize the mobility, but it does not provide an\\nexternal interface to interact with it.\\nIn 2015, ITS Austria West [11] presented a real life trafﬁc\\nmonitoring system that uses a mesoscopic version of SUMO\\n(this version of the simulator is not freely available). This\\nproject monitors a road network with 248,749 nodes and\\n323,282 road segments with a total length of 27,437 km.\\nThey have ﬁve different trafﬁc information sources providing\\nﬂoating car data and a trafﬁc demand model for the simulation\\nof 1.2 million routes and 1.6 million vehicles.\\nThe ITS Austria West scenario is a very good example of\\nthe effort required to build and maintain a trafﬁc scenario.\\nThere exist many other scenarios that are well designed, but\\nthese are not freely available to the community as they often\\nrely on proprietary information.\\nWith LuST Scenario we wanted to build a tool for the\\nscientiﬁc community. In order to do so, we used only freely\\nand publicly available datasets and software.\\nIII. L UST S CENARIO\\nTopology\\nIn order to create a realistic scenario we decided to start\\nfrom a real mid-sized European city. The topology of many\\nEuropean cities consists of a central downtown area, sur-\\nrounded by all its different neighbourhoods, which are linked\\nby arterial roads [12]. Another important characteristic is the\\npresence of a highway on the outskirts that surrounds the city.\\nThe size of the metropolitan area is another very important\\nproperty: the scenario must be big enough to show the standard\\ncongestion patterns visible in modern cities, but it must be\\nadequately small to permit simulations in a reasonable amount\\nof time. The City of Luxembourg meets those requirements.\\nAfter choosing the city, we used OpenStreetMap (OSM)\\nto extract its road topology. An OSM ﬁle contains all the\\nnecessary information about the environment and its accuracy\\nhas been detailed in [13]. We used JOSM [7] to extract and\\nmanually select and change points of interest and road seg-\\nments. In this phase we retrieved information about roads (of\\nany kind), trafﬁc lights, locations and names of bus stops; we\\nalso saved additional information about schools (i.e. location\\nand kind) to be used in the activity generation process, and\\nthe geometry of the buildings in order to create the polygons\\nrequired for the obstacles, important component for wireless\\nnetworks simulations.\\nMobility simulator\\nThe choice of the mobility simulator depends on the kind\\nof studies that have to be done. In case of vehicular communi-\\ncations studies [14], the vehicular mobility has to be coupled\\nwith a network simulator, therefore a micromobilty simulator\\nsuch as SUMO is appropriate for our needs.', metadata={'source': 'example_research_paper.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Fig. 1. LuST Scenario Topology.\\nAs the aim of this scenario is to have a working SUMO\\nsimulation, all the intersections were checked manually for\\ncorrectness. Using an iterative process with JOSM, netconvert\\n[15] and SUMO, we ensure that no intersection represented\\nan unrealistic bottleneck for the trafﬁc ﬂows. This iterative\\nprocess was necessary in order to construct a road network\\nwith the proper intersection geometry and segment shape\\nrequired by SUMO. These changes resulted in some minor\\ndifferences in the topology (i.e. the angle between two streets\\nmay be different and that would slightly change the shape\\nof the roads) that had to be taken into consideration while\\ngenerating bus stops, bus routes and the polygons for the\\nbuildings.\\nTo provide more ﬂexibility, we decided not to impose any\\nvehicle restrictions on any edge or lane (i.e. we removed the\\nlanes reserved for speciﬁc type vehicles). In order to maintain\\nthe trafﬁc patterns close to reality, we modiﬁed the number of\\nlanes in some segments of the roads. We tried to standardise\\nthe roads in order to obtain a scenario that could easily be\\nmodiﬁed or extended.\\nFigure 1 shows the topology of the LuST Scenario, with\\nstreets coloured by type.

All of these are retrieved\\nfrom OSM and STATEC.\\nMobility\\nThe trafﬁc model is based on a mobility study that describes\\ntrafﬁc characteristics over recent years [18]. We decided to\\ntune the trafﬁc demand between 200,000 and 300,000 vehicles\\nper day, depending on which trafﬁc demand we want to\\nsimulate (details are in Section Trafﬁc Demand ). The public\\ntransport database was used to retrieve the information about\\nbus routes [19]. A total of 563 bus stops were added to the\\nscenario. As shown in Table III, we added 38 bus routes inside\\nthe city for a total of 2,336 buses over the 24 hours period. The\\nlocation of the bus stops in the LuST Scenario is not the same\\nas the one in the OSM ﬁle (as mentioned earlier), however we\\ntried to keep them as close as possible. For this reason, we had\\nto rebuild the bus routes to match the new bus stop locations.\\nFigure 2, depicts the recomputed bus routes (in red). Figure\\n3 shows an intersection located in the city centre; the yellow\\nsquares are the inductive loops positioned 5m [20] from the\\nintersection and the green boxes annotated with an H are the\\nbus stops. With an additional conﬁguration ﬁle it is possible\\nto deﬁne location and sampling behaviour of the inductive\\nloops. We positioned them at every intersection with a trafﬁc\\nlight, on the highway, and on the on and off ramps (see Table\\nIV). We ﬁxed the location of each inductive loop close to the\\nintersection to allow dynamic adjustments of the trafﬁc light\\nsystem using the information provided by the detectors as a\\nfeasible extension of the simulation. In case of the inductive\\nloops situated on the highway, one of the possible usage is the\\nmonitoring of trafﬁc ﬂows on the peripheral roads.', metadata={'source': 'example_research_paper.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

U SECASES\\nThe LuST Scenario is a framework that provides realistic\\nmobility patterns for a mid-size city. The mobility traces\\nprovided can be used as an input for other types of simulators\\nsuch as NS3 or OMNet++ in order to evaluate network\\nprotocols. We will now show how the LuST scenario can\\nbe used in association with Veins [24] to obtain a closed-\\nloop feedback between SUMO and OMNet++. Using LuST\\nin combination with those tools allows the study of both,\\nthe performance of Vehicular-to-X protocols and the related\\napplications. Further, the scenario allows to evaluate different\\nmulti-modal strategies (e.g. for commuters). Using Veins, it\\nis possible to conﬁne the computation of the connectivity\\nnetwork to a restricted area, enabling the simulation of a\\nsmaller trafﬁc scenario that only uses a subset of the available\\nroad network, allowing testing of protocols and applications\\non different scales without changing the mobility patterns.\\nIn our urban area there are 203 intersections managed by\\na trafﬁc light system. These intersections can be used to\\ntest different optimisation strategies (e.g. green waves) or\\nemergency protocols to allow ﬁreﬁghters, ambulances or the\\npolice to be prioritised.\\nIn the next paragraph we explore in more detail two possible\\nuse cases of the LuST Scenario. In the ﬁrst, we vary the\\npercentage of vehicles allowed to change their route in case\\nof congestion, and in the second we use Veins and OMNet++\\nto compute the average number of ﬁrst-hop neighbours that\\nconnected vehicles encounter in a smaller area of the city.\\nRouting\\nFor the default scenario, 70% of the vehicles are equipped\\nwith a routing device, allowing to change route if a congestion\\nis encountered. We motivate this parameter by the fact that\\nmost of the local commuters are familiar with the road network\\nand know at least one alternative path. Further, more and more\\ncars are equipped with real time navigation services allowing\\na better usage of the available road capacity.\\nFig. 8. Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function of the number of route\\nchanges in the different scenarios.\\nIn SUMO, each vehicle can be equipped with different\\nkinds of devices in order to interact with their environment.\\nUsing the on-board routing system, it is possible to change the\\npercentage of cars that react to their surroundings, obtaining\\nscenarios with different levels of congestion to test different\\nrouting strategies. We decided to vary the percentage of\\nvehicles equipped with the routing device from 50% to 90%\\nand evaluate the impact on the number of route changes\\nfor each vehicle and the impact on the experienced waiting\\ntime. Figure 8 present the Empirical Cumulative Distribution\\nFunction (ECDF) for the number of route changes in the\\nexperiments, we see that lowering the percentage of vehicles\\nthat are allowed to react to trafﬁc congestion increases the\\nnumber of route changes for the ones that are equipped with\\na routing system. Nevertheless, even with only 50% of the\\nvehicles equipped with the routing device, 95% of the vehicles\\nin the simulation change their route less than 4 times.\\nThe waiting time experienced by the vehicles is another\\ninteresting aspect impacted by the percentage of vehicles\\nequipped with a routing system. The waiting time is deﬁned\\nas the number of seconds in which the vehicle speed is\\nlower than 0.1 m/s during the simulation. Given its deﬁnition,\\nthe waiting time is a fair measurement of trafﬁc congestion.\\nFigure 9 present its ECDF. Here the difference between the\\nexperiments is more visible. In case of 50% of vehicles\\nequipped with the device, we see that more than 15% of the\\nvehicle spend more than 30 minutes blocked in trafﬁc, which,\\nfor this scenario, represents 45.000 vehicles. In case of 70%\\nof vehicles equipped with the device (default value) only 2%\\nor 3% of the vehicles will experience a waiting time longer\\nthan 30 minutes.\\nIt is important to consider that the shape of the trafﬁc\\ndemand will change by varying the percentage of rerouted\\nvehicles.

In fact, as shown\\nin Figure 10, all the rush hour peaks will be delayed due to a\\ncongested network.\\nThe routing used by the on-board devices provided by\\nSUMO, represents the First Wardrop Principle of equilibrium\\n[25], the selﬁsh user approach. In this case, the vehicles have\\ncomplete information concerning the overall trafﬁc situation\\nin order to take the best decision.

The resizing of the simulation scenario\\nto this area can be done both in SUMO and in OMNet++.\\nReshaping the scenario in SUMO will imply a change in the\\nmobility pattern given that all the vehicles with an origin out-\\nside the area will not be simulated.

In the TAPAS\\nCologne paper [6] the authors provided an extensive evaluation\\nof the clustering of the vehicles for their scenario compared\\nto two mobility traces for the cities of Turin and Zurich.\\nWe were not able to obtain the latter so we rely on the\\nﬁndings referenced in the TAPAS Cologne paper. The aim\\nis to prove that the scenario is realistic and that this metric\\nis crucial in order to have reliable result in case of the\\nevaluation of a network protocol. Their argument is about the\\nfact that in the other mobility traces, given the higher degree of\\nconnected nodes, the network would result more stable, mining\\nthe reliability of the results obtained for the evaluation of a\\nnetwork protocol, and the same architecture with the other\\ntraces could lead to over-optimistic results. We completely\\nagree with this conjecture, and we would like to add that the\\npresence of the building in the LuST Scenario brings a higher\\nlevel of realism as the signal propagation is considered. In\\norder to be comparable with the TAPAS Cologne scenario,\\ngiven that the presence of buildings is never mentioned, we\\nrun the same experiment with and without polygons for the\\nchannel simulation. As expected, in case of simulation without\\nbuildings, the average size of the clusters is larger compared\\nto the one with the polygons (from approximatively 16 to\\napproximatively 8 nodes), and this has an impact on the\\nreliability of the evaluation [28].', metadata={'source': 'example_research_paper.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
