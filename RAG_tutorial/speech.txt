Re: New Grad Java Developer - Contacts

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the New Grad Java Developer - Contacts position at Constant Contact. With a diverse background in software engineering, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your innovative team that makes communication technology accessible and simple at Constant Contact.

The reason I have applied for this position is because I relate very closely to the idea of catering to small business owners and entrepreneurs. Having independently created various solutions for small business owners as a freelancer, I believe problem-solving as a skill could be maximized when working with a non-established company. Moreover, the types of problems are never repetitive, which is why it’s always exciting to try and propose a new solution every single time.
I would also like to mention that, in addition to the hard skills I possess – which are mentioned in my resume, I am also a certified Digital Marketing Associate by Meta. The reason I tried to get this credential was simply because of my affinity towards marketing as a profession. I sincerely believe that using the technical knowledge that I possess, I can create state-of-the-art solutions in this domain, and I already have made a few.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have cultivated a diverse set of soft skills crucial for effective collaboration and project management. This includes conducting feasibility checks and engaging with stakeholders to ensure new features align with business objectives. I've actively sought feedback from end-users, enabling iterative improvements for consumer-facing projects. Serving as the point of contact for external teams, I've showcased strong communication and problem-solving abilities, ensuring seamless coordination between teams. Furthermore, I've taken on mentorship roles, guiding interns and junior developers through their professional journey and imparting best practices for writing high-quality code.

As a member of your team, I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences to design and implement tools and services that have a positive impact on engineering productivity. Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with the needs of your team.

Sincerely,
Sarthak Khanduja
